title: 'Learn more about our acronym: RETINA'
---


Our acronym stands for "**RE**volutionising monitoring systems and **T**echniques in the **IN**formation **A**ge." 

The [retina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina) is a layer of nerve cells located on the back inside wall of our eyeball, near the optic nerve that helps to convert light into signals that our brain can interpret.

Just like the retina helps us to convert light into signals that our brain can interpret, the projects under  RETINA are expected to convert the data signals into interpretable results through statistics, mathematics and machine learning  based frameworks for anomaly detection. The overall aim of this project is therefore to tackle the key mathematical challenges in the early detection of anomalies in different data scenarios.
