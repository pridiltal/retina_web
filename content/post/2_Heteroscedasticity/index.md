title: 'Heteroscedasticity- Root Digging'
---

In statistics, a vector of random variables is heteroscedastic (or heteroskedastic;[a] from Ancient Greek hetero "different" and skedasis "dispersion") if the variability of the random disturbance is different across elements of the vector. Here, variability could be quantified by the variance or any other measure of statistical dispersion.

Hetero derives from the Greek word heteros meaning "different" or "other". It may refer to: Heterodoxy, belief or practice that differs from what is assumed as orthodoxy

The word “heteroscedasticity” comes from the Greek, and quite literally means data with a different (hetero) dispersion (skedasis). ... More technically, it refers to data with unequal variability (scatter) across a set of second, predictor variables. Heteroscedastic data tends to follow a cone shape on a scatter graph

The inverse of heteroscedasticity is homoscedasticity, which indicates that a DV's variability is equal across values of an IV.

homo has a greek origin "same"
