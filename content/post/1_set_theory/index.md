title: 'Fundamental Laws of Set Algebra- Root Digging'
---

This post provides an  intuition about the names of the fundamental laws of Set Algebra.

A *set* can be viewed as any  well-defined collection of *objects*. The objects in a set may or may not have similar properties. The word "set" has a Latin origin and is derived from the word  *"secta"* or *"sect"*. The Latin root *sect* means "cut".  [Many English words, such as **sect**ion, **sect**or, in**sect**, dis**sect**, and inter**sect**  also  have this Latin root](https://membean.com/wrotds/sect-cut).
The word *sect* also refers to a subgroup of a religious, political, or philosophical belief system.


## Algebra of Sets

Sets under the operations of union, intersection, and complement satisfy various laws with well-established names. The roots of these names they borrow from other languages provide  additional intuition and
understanding of the underlying concepts.

**Laws of the Algebra of Sets**

**Idempotent Laws**  
$$A\cup A =A \quad\quad\quad\quad A\cap A =A$$

Under Idempotent Law, the operations can be applied without changing  the initial values of the operands.  The term **"Idem"** has a Latin
origin which means **"the same"**. The second part **"potent"** also has a Latin origin and comes from the Latin word **"posse"** which means **"being powerful"** or **"being able"**. Idempotent Laws show their **power** of remaining on the **same** values, irrespective of the operations being performed on it.

**Associative Laws**  
$$(A\cup B)\cup C =A\cup (B\cup C) \quad\quad\quad\quad (A\cap B)\cap C =A\cap (B\cap C)$$

Under Associative law, the operands can be **associated** by operators in any way desired.
 The Latin root is **"associare"** which means **"join with"** or **"to unite"**. Under associative law the **grouping** (or **association**) of the operands does not affect the result.


**Commutative Laws**  
$$A\cup B =B\cup A\quad\quad\quad\quad A\cap B = B\cap A$$

According to commutative laws, the order in which the operators are evaluated does not affect the result. The word **"commute"** comes from Latin
word **"commutare"**", meaning **"to change altogether"**" (from *com* - ‘altogether’ + *mutare* ‘to change’). Therefore, under commutative property we can **move** or (*change*) operands around and still get the same results. The Latin root **"idem"** and then in Late Latin **"identitas"** means **"same"**. 

**Distributive Laws**  
$$A\cup( B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A\cup C)\quad\quad\quad\quad A\cap( B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A\cap C)$$

The word **"Distributive"** has a Latin origin and comes from the word **"distribut"**, meaning **"divided up"**. Under Distributive Law we **"spread out"** or **"share"** the initial part with all the other terms.

**Identity Laws**  
$$A \cup \phi =A\quad\quad\quad\quad A \cap \phi =\phi$$

$$A \cup U =U\quad\quad\quad\quad A \cap U =A$$

$\phi$ and $U$ are the identity elements in set algebra. Under identity law the characteristics of the operands determine the *owner* or the *holder* of the final result. The word **identity**  means **"quality of being identical"** and has a Latin origin.

**Involution Law**  
$$(A^\prime)^\prime = A$$

The involution law states that the double complement of a set gives the same set. The word **"involution"** is derived from the Latin word **"volvere"**, meaning "to roll" (from **in** - *‘into’* + **volvere** - *‘to roll’*).  What happen if you *roll up* your t-shirt inside out twice.

**Complement Laws**  

$$A \cup A^\prime =U\quad\quad\quad\quad \phi^\prime =U$$

The word **"complement"** is derived form the Latin root, **"complere"** which means **"fill up"** (from *com* - 'expressing intensive force' + *plere* - ‘fill’). As the name suggested, the above two expressions give the universal set, which contains all the objects under consideration.

The below expressions also in regards to the universal set which is the **complete** set of objects under consideration.

$$A \cap A^\prime =\phi \quad\quad\quad\quad    U^\prime =\phi $$

**DeMorgan's Laws**  
$$(A \cup B)^\prime =A^\prime \cap B^\prime\quad\quad\quad\quad (A \cap B)^\prime= A^\prime \cup B^\prime$$

According to the De Morgan's Law, the complement of the union of two sets is the intersection of their complements and the complement of the intersection of two sets is the union of their complements. The law is named after the British mathematician and logician, Augustus De Morgan (1806 – 1871).
