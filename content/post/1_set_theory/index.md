title: 'Fundamental Laws of Set Algebra- Root Digging'
---

This post provides an  intuition about the names of the fundamental laws of Set Algebra.

A **set** can be viewed as any  well-defined collection of *objects*. The objects in a set may or may not have similar properties. The word "set" has a Latin origin and is derived from the word  *"secta"* or *"sect"*. The Latin root *sect* means "cut".  [Many English words, such as **sect**ion, **sect**or, in**sect**, dis**sect**, and inter**sect**  also  have this Latin root](https://membean.com/wrotds/sect-cut).
The word *sect* also refers to a subgroup of a religious, political, or philosophical belief system.


## Algebra of Sets

Sets under the operations of union, intersection, and complement satisfy various laws with well-established names. The roots of these names they borrow from other languages provide  additional intuition and
understanding of the underlying concepts.

**Laws of the Algebra of Sets**

**Idempotent Laws**  


\[A\cup A =A \quad\quad\quad\quad A\cap A =A\]


$$A\cup A =A \quad\quad\quad\quad A\cap A =A$$

**Associative Laws**  
$$(A\cup B)\cup C =A\cup (B\cup C) \quad\quad\quad\quad (A\cap B)\cap C =A\cap (B\cap C)$$
**Commutative Laws**  
$$A\cup B =B\cup A\quad\quad\quad\quad A\cap B = B\cap A$$
**Distributive Laws**  
$$A\cup( B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A\cup C)\quad\quad\quad\quad A\cap( B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A\cap C)$$

**Identity Laws**  
$$A \cup \phi =A\quad\quad\quad\quad A \cap \phi =\phi$$

$$A \cup U =U\quad\quad\quad\quad A \cap U =A$$
**Involution Law**  
$$(A^\prime)^\prime = A$$
**Complement Laws**  
$$A \cup A^\prime =U\quad\quad\quad\quad A \cap A^\prime =\phi$$
$$U^\prime =\phi \quad\quad\quad\quad \phi^\prime =U$$

**DeMorgan's Laws**  
$$(A \cup B)^\prime =A^\prime \cap B^\prime\quad\quad\quad\quad (A \cap B)^\prime= A^\prime \cup B^\prime$$
