[Let’s Enjoy Cricket with R!](/workshops/Introduction-to-TIdy-Tools.html)

In this [blogpost](/workshops/Introduction-to-TIdy-Tools.html) we will use `cricketdata` R package by Rob Hyndman and his team, to get a better understanding of the concepts of exploration, visualization, and potential analyses.

This post was inspire by Rob Hyndman’s recent post on [The cricketdata package](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/cricketdata/).
