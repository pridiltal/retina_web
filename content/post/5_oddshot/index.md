title: 'The odd shot - A Photography Competition Exploring Anomalies'
---

# Calling all photography enthusiasts! 

## Do you have a keen eye for capturing the unexpected or anomalies? 

## Do you want to showcase your artistic talents while contributing to a deeper understanding of data anomalies?

## Then join us for our upcoming photo competition!

Outliers, also known as anomalies, play a vital role in numerous domains, including cybersecurity, fraud detection, environmental monitoring, and many others. However, there is no universal definition for an anomaly, and the anomaly detection algorithms are heavily influenced by the way we define them. As such, this photo competition aims to explore the various aspects that can be considered when defining an anomaly and promote a deeper understanding of this critical concept.

This photo competition aims to explore the different aspects that can be considered when defining an anomaly. You can capture everyday situations that demonstrate the theoretical concept of outliers. In addition, your photo should be accompanied by a short description or explanation of how it relates to the concept of outliers.


### Your photo has the power to enhance our understanding of the concept of anomalies and the different aspects we should consider when defining them. So grab your camera, and let's capture the unexpected!

## Submissions for the photo competition will be accepted until May 30th, 2023. 

**To enter, please email your photo and description to retinalab.owsd@gmail.com with the subject line "The Odd Shot".**

## We look forward to seeing your creative submissions!\
