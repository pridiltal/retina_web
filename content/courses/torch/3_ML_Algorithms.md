### Machine Learning Algorithms

Machine learning algorithms can be categorised into three major groups 
   - supervised learning (deals with the labelled data)
   - unsupervised learning (deals with the unlabelled data)
   - reinforcement learning (a feedback-based Machine learning technique that allows an agent to learn in an interactive environment by trial and error)
   
#### List of Common Machine Learning Algorithms
