## Overview

Machine learning research uses theoretical concepts from a variety of mathematical fields such as convex optimization, probability, statistics, functional analysis, calculus and computational learning theory. It is vital to get familiar with these mathematical concepts in order to fully participate in many exciting research directions. The purpose of this reading group is to gain a better understanding of some mathematical foundations relevant to machine learning research.

## Meeting format

The ODDLab Reading Group meets regularly (usually weekly) to discuss topics on Machine Learning tools and techniques.
