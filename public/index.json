The project is funded under OWSD Early Career Fellowship scheme awarded to Dr. Priyanga Dilini Talagala (2021-2022).\nWith the spread of the Internet of Things and as more and more devices are providing live streaming data, detecting anomalies in this data is becoming an increasingly important research topic. Anomaly detection has been explored within diverse research areas and application domains such as fraud detection, health monitoring, and environmental monitoring. Despite the ever-increasing attention and resources devoted to it, some challenges in anomaly detection are not supported by existing methods. RETINA project is in an attempt to reduce this gap by introducing novel anomaly detection frameworks for different data scenarios.\nAbout our acronym: RETINA\nAbout our logo\n","date":1623974400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1623974400,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://retinalab.netlify.app/author/retina/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/retina/","section":"authors","summary":"RETINA: (REvolutionising monitoring systems and Techniques in the INformation Age”) is a research and innovation project funded by the Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World (OWSD), a program unit of United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).","tags":null,"title":"RETINA","type":"authors"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"About ODDLab ODDLab is a Virtual Research Laboratory (VRL) that supports the scientific work, education, knowledge exchange and intelligent searching in the field of Outlier Detection and related topics.\nCode of Conduct ","date":1612137600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1614729600,"objectID":"7d253b71e362d307b3aadeef104910b7","permalink":"https://retinalab.netlify.app/courses/oddlab/","publishdate":"2021-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/oddlab/","section":"courses","summary":"ODDLab is a Virtual Research Laboratory (VRL) that supports the scientific work, education, knowledge exchange and intelligent searching in the field of Outlier Detection.","tags":null,"title":"ODDLab - Outlier Detection for Development Lab","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"TORCH (Tips fOr ResearCH) Reproducible Reporting Reproducible research provides a workflow from raw data to final report/manuscript in such a way that every step along the way is reproducible.
